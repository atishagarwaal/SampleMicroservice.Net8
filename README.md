The SampleMicroservice.Net8 project is a microservice-based application built using .NET 8.0. 

It includes multiple APIs to handle different aspects of a retail system:-
1. Products
2. Customers
3. Orders
  
The project also features a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) API, which acts as a gateway for all the underlying microservices.
