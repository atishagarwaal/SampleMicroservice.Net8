The SampleMicroservice.Net8 project is a microservices-based application built using .NET 8.0, SQL Server, MongoDB, and RabbitMQ. The project follows the Clean Architecture principles. Design patterns such as CQRS with MediatR, Repository Pattern, and Unit of Work are implemented to maintain a well-structured and modular application.

The microservices application consists of the following services:

1. Order Service
2. Product Service
3. Customer Service

Additionally, the project includes a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) API, which acts as an API gateway to aggregate and streamline data retrieval from these microservices.
