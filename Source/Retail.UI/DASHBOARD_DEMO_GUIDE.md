# ðŸŽ¯ **Dashboard Demo Guide - Event-Driven Architecture Showcase**

## ðŸš€ **Getting Started**

### **1. Start Your Services**
```bash
# Start in this order:
1. MessagingInfrastructure (creates RabbitMQ topology)
2. Retail.Customers (Port 7001)
3. Retail.Products (Port 7003) 
4. Retail.Orders.Write (Port 7002)
5. Retail.Orders.Read (Port 7005)
6. Retail.BFF (Port 7004)
7. Retail.UI (Port 7000) - This dashboard
```

### **2. Access the Dashboard**
- Navigate to: `https://localhost:7000`
- Click **"Dashboard"** in the navigation menu

---

## ðŸ“Š **Dashboard Overview**

### **Service Status Section**
- **Real-time monitoring** of all microservices
- **Color-coded status**: Green (Running), Red (Stopped)
- **Service icons** for easy identification
- **Automatic health checks** via Swagger endpoints

### **Business Data Tabs**
- **ðŸ“¦ Products & Inventory**: View products, adjust stock levels
- **ðŸ“‹ Orders**: View order history, create new orders
- **ðŸ‘¥ Customers**: View customer information

### **Event Flow Visualization**
- **Message Flow**: How services communicate
- **Order Processing Events**: Real-time event timeline

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Demo Scenario: Creating an Order**

### **Step 1: View Current Data**
1. **Go to Products tab** - See available inventory
2. **Go to Customers tab** - Note customer IDs
3. **Go to Orders tab** - See current order history

### **Step 2: Create a New Order**
1. **Click "Create Order"** button in Orders tab
2. **Select Customer** from dropdown (e.g., Customer ID 1)
3. **Select Product** from dropdown (e.g., Product ID 1)
4. **Enter Quantity** (ensure it doesn't exceed inventory)
5. **Review Order Summary** - shows total cost and stock validation
6. **Click "Create Order"**

### **Step 3: Watch the Event Flow**
The dashboard will show **real-time events** as the order processes:

```
âœ… Dashboard: Opening order creation modal
âœ… Orders: Creating order for customer 1 with X units of Product Name
âœ… Orders.Write: Order created successfully with ID X
âœ… Products: Inventory updated for Product Name (reduced by X)
âœ… Customers: Customer 1 order history updated  
âœ… Orders.Read: Order X added to read model
```

## ðŸ”„ **Event-Driven Architecture in Action**

### **What Happens Behind the Scenes**

1. **Order Write Service** receives the order
2. **Product Service** validates inventory and updates stock
3. **Customer Service** updates customer order history
4. **Order Read Service** updates read model
5. **Events are published** to RabbitMQ for other services

### **Service Communication Flow**
```
BFF Service â†’ Customer Service (for customer data)
BFF Service â†’ Order Read Service (for order data)  
BFF Service â†’ Product Service (for product data)
Order Write Service â†’ Product Service (for inventory updates)
Product Service â†’ Customer Service & Order Read Service (via RabbitMQ events)
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ **Inventory Management Demo**

### **Adjust Product Inventory**
1. **Go to Products tab**
2. **Click "Adjust" button** on any product row
3. **Enter new inventory value**
4. **Click "Update Inventory"**
5. **Watch events** show inventory update

### **Inventory Status Indicators**
- **ðŸŸ¢ High**: Green (Inventory > 10)
- **ðŸŸ¡ Medium**: Yellow (Inventory 1-10)  
- **ðŸ”´ Low**: Red (Inventory = 0)

---

## ðŸŽ¨ **UI Features**

### **Interactive Controls**
- **Tab Navigation**: Switch between Products, Orders, Customers
- **Refresh Buttons**: Update data from microservices
- **Action Buttons**: Adjust inventory, create orders
- **Modal Dialogs**: User-friendly forms

### **Real-Time Updates**
- **Event Timeline**: Live order processing events
- **Service Status**: Automatic health monitoring
- **Data Refresh**: Real-time business data updates

### **Responsive Design**
- **Desktop**: Full feature set with side-by-side layouts
- **Tablet**: Optimized layouts for medium screens
- **Mobile**: Stacked layouts for small screens

---

## ðŸš¨ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **Services Not Starting**
   - Check RabbitMQ is running on port 15672
   - Verify database connections
   - Check service ports in launchSettings.json

2. **Data Not Loading**
   - Ensure microservices are accessible
   - Check API endpoints in browser
   - Verify service URLs in code-behind

3. **Buttons Not Working**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure all services are running
   - Verify HTTP client configuration

### **Debug Information**
- **Browser Console**: JavaScript and network errors
- **Service Logs**: API failures and exceptions
- **Event Timeline**: Real-time operation tracking
- **Service Status**: Health check results

## ðŸŽ¯ **Demo Script for Presentations**

### **Opening (2 minutes)**
"Welcome to our Retail Microservices Dashboard. This demonstrates a modern, event-driven architecture where services communicate asynchronously through RabbitMQ."

### **Service Overview (1 minute)**
"Here we can see all our microservices running - BFF, Customers, Products, Orders Write, and Orders Read. Each has a specific domain responsibility."

### **Business Operations (2 minutes)**
"Let me show you how we manage inventory and create orders. Watch how the system validates stock levels and processes orders in real-time."

### **Event Flow Demo (3 minutes)**
"Now let's create an order and watch the event-driven architecture in action. Notice how events flow through the system and update multiple services."

### **Architecture Benefits (1 minute)**
"This architecture provides scalability, fault tolerance, and real-time processing. Services can be deployed independently and communicate reliably through message queues."
